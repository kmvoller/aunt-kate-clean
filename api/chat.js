**Immediate Steps:**
1. **Request the full denial letter** - Get the specific reason code
2. **Review your policy** - Confirm the service should be covered  
3. **Gather documentation** - Medical records, doctor's notes, policy documents
4. **File an appeal within deadlines** - Usually 60-180 days

**Appeal Success Tips:**
‚Ä¢ 60% of properly documented appeals succeed
‚Ä¢ Use medical terminology, not emotional language
‚Ä¢ Get your doctor to write a strong support letter
‚Ä¢ Reference specific policy language
‚Ä¢ Keep copies and send via certified mail

**Next Steps:**
- Internal appeal first (required)
- External review if internal fails (often binding in your favor)

Would you like help writing your appeal letter or understanding the specific denial codes?`;
